<center><font size="+3">Fire Force Outrage!!!</font></center><br><br>


<center><font size="+2">"Fire Force" is special and deserves a better ending!<br>My alternate ending starts at <a href="58.jpg" <font size="+2"> Volume 25 Page 58.</a><br> --We cut hard there!!-- </font></center><br>


<center><font size="+2">When Shinra is unconcious, Adolla Linked with Inca, and seeing the "past"---NO>:( <br> Shinra went into a coma from Juggernaut's blast and then drowning!</font></center><br><br>

<center><font size="+2"> ★NOTHING in my version has to do with "imagination"!!! ARRG!>:8 <br>Adolla is the MOON. Evangelist lives on the Moon and the White Clad have been attemping to launch moon rockets.<br></font></center> <br><br>

<center><font size="+2"> ★NO virgin birth! <a href="Exhibit A.jpg" <font size="+2">Exhibit A</a> is second ending theme "Nounai" when we see<br> Shinra's mother's arms wrapped around a man's back in bed! That's how little brothers are made.<br></font></center> <br><br>

<center><font size="+2"> ★As a 'Murican, I knew nothing of "Soul Eater", so to me, Haumea wailing,<br>Adolla Linking with Evangelist, looking at the Moon, as the finale to Season 2<br>was THE big reveal the White Clad have been all about the Moon! <br></font></center> <br><br>

<center><font size="+2"> ★I'm in LOVE with Dr.Giovanni, and I thought for sure he was Vulcan's uncle!<br>Falsely accused of killing his father and brother!(Vulcan's dad and grandpa)<br>Just like Shinra is falsely accused of killing his mother! Good writing rhymes like that, right?!<br></font></center> <br><br>

<center><font size="+2"> ★In my version, Evangelist is a youthful, godly-powerful alien.<br>★The Great Cataclysm was accidentally caused by her, 250 years ago.<br>She was playing and accidentally surfed too close to our sun!<br>Desperate to escape its gravity, she damaged the sun! Making a terrible coronal mass ejection!<br>She hoped no life was in the path, but it was. Earth.<br>Horrified, she transformed as many creatures as she could into having bodies like hers,<br>that aren't hurt by radiation. She turned them into Infernals. <br></font></center> <br><br>


<center><font size="+2"> ★Many who were Infernalized are living happily on the Moon!<br>Hibana's little sister nuns are fine on the Moon!<br>Sumire created a portal to show them to Hibana,<br>but this also showed us that infernals are in agony when<br>exposed to Earth's oxygen!<br>Thus why Infernals rampage when in Tokyo.<br></font></center> <br><br>




<center><font size="+2"> ★Spontaneous combustion Infernalization is caused by<br>exceeding the radiation exposure limit of non-powered people.<br>Evangelist tried to let life stay as it was, but if the radiation<br>exposure gets to a fatal level, she made it so Earth life<br>will automatically transform to Infernal form and survive.<br></font></center> <br><br>




<center><font size="+2"> ★Holy Water!: Evangelist attempted to SEAL the coronal mass ejection's radiation<br>by bringing tons of neutrons. These neutrons are now in Earth's water, making heavy-water<br>which suppresses radiation a bit. This suppression hid Iris's Adolla Burst until now.<br><br>★This heavy-water "Sealant" is the key to Ignition Abilities:<br>Second Gens have more Sealant than radiation,<br>Third Gens have more radiation than Sealant but control their<br>flames' direction using Second Gen-style Sealant movement.<br></font></center> <br><br>



<center><font size="+2"> ★3rd ending theme song lyric "I'm upside down and no one knows it"<br>is super important!: Shinra's radiation is concentrated in his feet!<br>When Shinra sees Adolla, he is looking at it upside down!!<br>The black mass of skeletons is Evangelist's view of everything that<br>has ever died on Earth. The pure white "sky" of Shinra's Adolla view,<br>is actually the MOON! The bright, clean paradise! That bright goodness<br>is what Captains Hague and Burns saw and loved!
<br></font></center> <br><br>




<center><font size="+2"> ★<a href="Page 182.jpg" <font size="+2"> Volume 22, Page 182</a>, we see Burns teleported to the Moon<br>by Evangelist, personally. Transferring into his Infernal body to<br>live on the Moon-paradise he saw that had converted him.
<br></font></center> <br>

<br>
<center><font size="+2"> ★Shinra's coma will last for 3 months.<br>Doctors advise his friends to talk and read aloud<br>at his bedside to help his brain heal and wake up.<br>Licht reads aloud "The NeverEnding Story", which puts a lot of<br>delusions in Shinra's head that "imagination" is the answer to everything.<br><br>★Volumes 25-34 are Shinra hearing about the real story<br>but twisted through his delusional comatose state.<br><br>★When Shinra pulls through and awakens, Company 8 have a<br>good laugh that Shinra, in his coma-dream, made himself Jesus the Messiah!<br>In time, Shinra heals with minor brain damage from near-drowning.<br>He returns to Fire Soldier duty!
<br></font></center> <br>


<center><font size="+2"> ★Now THAT is how the bad ending is undone!! Fourth-wall intact! Continue!

<br><br><br>★From there we're heading to a super happy ending where the<br>White Clad make it to the Moon! AND Vulcan uses the<br>radiation contamination on Earth AS his miraculous<br>energy source and saves the Earth!<br>Vulcan Jurassic-Parks the animals back, too! <br><br>★Evangelist transforms Shinra's mother back into a human.
